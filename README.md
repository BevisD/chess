A bitboard based chess engine with GUI

The aim of this repository is to gain an understanding of how bitboards are used to represent positions of chess boards, and the various ways that bitboards can be manipulated to move chess pieces. The use of bitboards is more complex than 2D arrays for example, however their speed is vital for the implementation of chess bots using either DFS or BFS. In future these algorithms will be implemented.
